# Getting Started with Meine

## What is Meine?

Meine is a powerful, cross-platform command-line interface tool designed for efficient file operations and system management. It combines the power of regex-based commands with a beautiful terminal user interface (TUI) to provide an enhanced file management experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Regex-Based Command System
Meine uses an intuitive regex-based command system that makes file operations simple and powerful:

```bash
# Basic file operations
del file.txt              # Delete a file
copy source.txt to dest/  # Copy a file
move old/ to new/         # Move a directory
rename doc.txt as new.txt # Rename a file
```

### 2. Terminal UI
The built-in Terminal UI provides:
- Interactive file browser
- Real-time system monitoring
- Command history and suggestions
- Mouse and keyboard support

### 3. System Dashboard
Monitor your system with simple commands:
```bash
cpu     # CPU usage and stats
