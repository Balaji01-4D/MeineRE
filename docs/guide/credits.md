### **Libraries and Tools Used**

This project would not have been possible without the powerful and inspiring Python libraries that significantly shaped its development:

  Core framework for the TUI (Text User Interface), providing a modern, responsive, and interactive layout.

- **[Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)**
  Used for rendering beautifully styled text, tables, and rich system outputs.

- **[Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)**
  Essential for object-oriented file path manipulation and directory operations.

- **[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)**
  Handles core file system operations such as creation, deletion, and navigation.

- **[psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil)**
  Enables access to low-level system stats like CPU, memory, and disk usage.



üôè **Huge thanks and applause** to the developers and contributors of these libraries. Your work made this project possible.
